# Hai-Ballet

Restore the Hai Ballet to the way it was.

The Hai Ballet is an exploit which allows the player to capture Shield Beetles
from the Unfettered Hai. For players who don't want to worry too much about
combat, it is a way of building a large and powerful fleet. The Hai Ballet was
removed in https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7471 by a few people
who want to force their play style onto others. Nothing in the game made you do
the Hai Ballet, but some developers decided you should not be allowed to do it
at all.

This small patch restores exploit.

Note that at the time of release, the change to the Hai Ballet is only in the
continuous build, and most players won't see any difference from this
patch until 7471 makes it into the release version.
